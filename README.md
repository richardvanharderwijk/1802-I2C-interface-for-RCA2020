# 1802-I2C-interface-for-RCA2020

This repository describes the design and implementation specifics of the drivers for the RCA2020 I2C interface. 

The RCA2020 system is an SBC (Single Board Computer) based on the 1970â€™s RCA CDP1802 COSMAC CPU. While specific for this system, the interface should be easily portable to any other 1802 system, both the hardware and the software.

Substantial parts of the necessary low level implementations are already detailed by the I2C controller supplier.
